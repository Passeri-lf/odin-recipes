        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup Asian sweet chili sauce like Mae Ploy</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon reduced sodium soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Asian chili sauce more or less to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 3 cups of water to a boil in a medium pot, then
            add 2 cups of rice and turn the heat down to <br> simmer. 
            Put the lid on and leave covered for 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>On a cutting board that has space, prep aromatics. 
            Chop onion and sweet peppers, then put a pan on <br> the
            stove at about half heat. Oil generously.
        </li>
        <li>When the pan is hot (<em>oil will start to steam</em>),
            add in your chopped veggies along with half a cup of <br> the
            pre-chopped carrots. Season with salt, garlic, and chili
            powder.
        </li>
        <li>Stir veggies occasionally for ~ 10 minutes then lower the
            heat. Remove them from the pan, and place <br>somewhere to the 
            side. 
        </li>
        <li>Turn the heat back up to medium-high, and prep your steak.
            Add garlic, salt, and pepper. Oil again, <br> and place in the
            pan. For a perfect medium-rare, cook each side for two 
            minutes. <strong>Do not fiddle with it!</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Bring heat to low, then add in your butter. Once completely
            melted, tilt the pan so it pools on one side.<br> With a spoon,
            scoop the butter on to your steak repeatedly for about 2 
            minutes. This is known as<br> <em>basting</em>.
        </li>
        <li>Keep steak pan on low heat, and turn <strong>off</strong> 
            the heat to your rice. Let everything sit for an additional 
            5 <br>minutes, then remove your steak from the pan. 
            <strong>Do not cut into it or touch it!</strong> 
            <br>(It is still cooking from the inside.)
        </li>
        <li>Your rice should be perfectly cooked now. Remove lid and 
            scoop a third of it into the steak pan we <br> just used. Add in 
            the veggies we cooked earlier to reheat them. The excess oil
            and fat from the steak is <br> what will be turning our white 
            rice, into <em>fried</em> rice. If there isn't enough oil, 
            feel free to add more to <br> the pan.
        </li>
        <li>Once rice is golden brown, turn off heat and scoop everything 
            into a dinner bowl of your choice. You <br> can now cut your steak
            into medium-sized bites, and add them into your bowl.
        </li>
        <li> Drizzle your sauce of choice over top, <em>(mine is teriyaki)
            </em>, then squeeze your lime over everything. <br> That's it! Enjoy!
        </li>
    </ol>
