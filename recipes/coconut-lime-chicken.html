    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk the coconut sauce ingredients together, set aside.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken breasts in the half through the equator to 
            create 4 fillets. Cover with plastic wrap and pound to an 
            even thickness. Pat dry. 
        </li>
        <li>Whisk the flour and all chicken seasoning together in a shallow
            dish. Dredge each breast in the mixture, shake off any excess, 
            then transfer to a dry surface.
        </li>
        <li>Melt the 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a 
            large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add chicken and 
            cook for 4-5 (<em>depending on thickness</em>) until golden 
            and cooked through. Transfer chicken to a plate, don't wipe
            out skillet.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium and add a drizzle of olive oil if needed.
            Add white parts of green onions and cook one minute. Add 
            garlic and ginger and cook 30 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and stir in the sauce, scraping up any brown
            bits on the bottom of the pan. Bring to a simmer until sauce is
            thickened, 1-2 minutes. Carefully taste <strong>(Don't burn your 
            tongue!)</strong> and adjust to taste, adding additional honey 
            for sweetener or lime juice for tangier.
        </li>
        <li>Add chicken and warm through. Garnish with cilantro and/or 
            basil and green onions. Serve over rice.
        </li>
