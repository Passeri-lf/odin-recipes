    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. 90% to 93% lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>12 taco shells-either hard or small 6 inch flour tortillas
            will work.
        </li>
        <li><em>Optional</em>: Shredded cheese, shredded lettuce, 
        chopped tomatoes, diced red onion, taco sauce, sour cream, 
        etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the beef to a large skillet over medium-high heat. Break
            the meat apart with a wooden spoon. Add the chili powder,
            cumin, salt, oregano, garlic powder, and pepper to the meat. 
            Stir well. Cook until the meat is cooked through, about 6-8 
            minutes, stirring occasionally.
        </li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium. Add the tomato sauce and water. Stir 
            to combine. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 7-8 minutes, until 
            some of the liquid evaporates but the meat mixture is still a
            little saucy. Remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Warm the taco shells according to their package directions.
        </li>
        <li>Fill the taco shells with 2 heaping tablespoons of taco meat. 
            top with desired toppings. 
        </li>
    </ol>
